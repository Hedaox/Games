            <h2>Internship at Bastion Studio</h2>
            <p>Internship I did for 2 months for the game <strong>La Porte des Fauconniers</strong> (French game that is not released yet). </p>
            <p>Here is the game trailer for its <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/la-porte-des-fauconniers-guerre-medievale#/"> indiegogo campaign</a> : </p>

            </div>
            <p>For this game, I mainly worked on the UI as well as the save system and the gameplay. </p>
            <p>The game also has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1493240/La_Porte_des_Fauconniers__Guerre_Mdivale/"> Steam page </a> for more information.</p>

            <h2>Internship at Safran Engineering Services</h2>
            <p>This is the end-of-study internship, lasting 6 months, that I did during my master's degree.</p>
			<p>The goal of this internship was to carry out proofs of concepts with Unity 3D in Virtual Reality.</p>
            <p>In particular, I had the opportunity to work with Leap Motion, a technology capable of detecting and representing the user's hands in 3D.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Another of the projects was to create a package allowing the use of virtual reality with multi-users features.</p>

            <h2>Mesh Manipulation</h2>
            <p>Some terrain mesh manipulation in Unity made to work in real time directly in the editor.</p>
            <div class="videoDiv">
               <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QNYUnBpoyuw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video"></iframe>
            </div>
            <p>This uses the open-source code <a href="https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoise_CSharp">FastNoise</a>, in order to produce the semi-random form. Directly in the editor we can create multiple layers of noise in order to make more complex shapes.</p>
            <p>With this I manage to make some procedurally generated terrain :</p>
            <div class="videoDiv">
               <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o-sNSRR6Y0E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="video"></iframe>
            </div>
            <p>The user interface is used to change Size and Seed for the procedurally generated Terrain. The seed is used to make different terrain form by moving noise position. The terrain also have different biomes depending on vertex height, vertex position and slope.</p>

         <h2>Shinning Champions</h2>
         <p>A small action-RPG prototype made in GameMaker. All the assets were made by myself. Very simple game where the player can move / attack, as well as collect equipment. For now you can only fight an unarmed individual in an arena that will respawn each time you leave the location.</p>

         <p><img src="Images/SC2.PNG" alt="map" class="responsive" width="50%" height="50%"></p>
         <p>To play use the directional arrows to move, A / Z to Attack, W / X to grab an object, C / V to drop an object from your hand, B / N / H to drop equipment and SPACE to interact . To fight in the arena, take the entrance at the top left, then move left and press SPACE to enter the arena.</p>
